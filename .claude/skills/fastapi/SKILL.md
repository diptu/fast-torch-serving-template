- **Execution**: Run `/fastapi <dir_name>`.
## 0: Organize the Project as Independent Services

As the application grows, organize it into **domain-oriented services**. Each service owns its APIs, business logic, models, repositories, schemas, tests, documentation, and TODOs.

## 0: Organize the Project as Independent Services

As the application grows, organize it into **domain-oriented services**. Each service owns its APIs, business logic, models, repositories, schemas, tests, documentation, and TODOs.

### Strategic Import Organization

To maintain clean, readable, and manageable codebases, follow these practices:

1. **The "Barrel" Pattern**: Use `__init__.py` files to export public-facing modules. This allows you to consolidate deep import paths into a single, clean import statement.
2. **`TYPE_CHECKING` for Circular Dependencies**: Isolate type imports within `if TYPE_CHECKING:` blocks to ensure imports are only processed during static analysis, not at runtime.
3. **Automated Sorting**: Use **Ruff** (configured in `pyproject.toml`) to enforce import order (Standard Library, Third-Party, Local Application).
4. **Service-First Refactoring**: If a file exceeds 15 imports, it is a "code smell." Refactor into smaller domain modules or use Dependency Injection to reduce logic complexity in route handlers.

### Recommended Project Structure

### Standard Service Structure

Every service should follow the same layout.

```text
torch-serving-template/
│
├── api/
│   ├── router.py
│   ├── endpoints/
│   └── dependencies.py
│
├── models/
├── schemas/
├── repositories/
├── services/
├── validators/
├── dependencies/
├── events/
├── tests/
├── docs/
├── README.md
└── TODO.md
└── Makefile
```

### Service Responsibilities

Each service should own:

* API routes
* Business logic
* Database models
* Repository layer
* Pydantic schemas
* Validation
* Dependencies
* Domain events
* Tests
* Documentation
* TODO list

Avoid placing unrelated business logic into another service.

### Shared Components

Only reusable, cross-cutting code belongs in shared locations.

Examples include:

* Common DTOs
* Pagination
* Generic validators
* Utility functions
* Shared enums
* Shared constants

Business-specific code should never live in shared modules.

### Documentation

Every service should include:

```text
README.md
```

Describing:

* Purpose
* Responsibilities
* API endpoints
* Dependencies
* Events
* Architecture

and

```text
TODO.md
```

Containing:

* Current tasks
* Planned work
* Technical debt
* Future enhancements


# 1. Concurrency Architecture & Async Rules

## Rule 1: Never Use `async def` for Blocking Operations

### Anti-Pattern

Running blocking operations inside an `async def` endpoint blocks the event loop and destroys concurrency.

Examples:

* `time.sleep()`
* `requests`
* Synchronous database drivers (`psycopg2`, `pymongo`)
* CPU-intensive operations

```python
@app.get("/users")
async def get_users():
    time.sleep(2)  # Blocks the event loop
```
### Explicit HTTP Status Constants
Using status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR instead of the magic number 500 improves code readability, prevents typos, and makes your codebase more maintainable.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, status
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/trigger-error")
def trigger_error():
    # Use status constants for clarity and maintainability
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
        content={"detail": "Internal server error."},
    )
```
### Always execute  application using the following structure:

```bash
uv run gunicorn app.main:app \
    -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker \
    -w 5 \
    -b 0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Production Practice

Use standard `def` for endpoints containing blocking code.

FastAPI automatically executes synchronous endpoints in a thread pool.

```python
@app.get("/users")
def get_users():
    time.sleep(2)
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

---

## Rule 2: Prefer Async-Compatible Libraries

When using `async def`, every I/O operation should also be asynchronous.

### Recommended Replacements

| Blocking Library | Async Alternative     |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| `time.sleep()`   | `asyncio.sleep()`     |
| `requests`       | `httpx.AsyncClient()` |
| `pymongo`        | `motor`               |
| `psycopg2`       | `asyncpg`             |
| SQLAlchemy Sync  | SQLAlchemy Async      |

Example:

```python
import asyncio
import httpx

@app.get("/external")
async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get("https://example.com")

    return response.json()
```

---

## Rule 3: Offload Heavy Computation

FastAPI excels at I/O-bound workloads, not CPU-bound workloads.

### Lightweight Tasks (<100 ms)

Can run directly inside endpoints under low traffic.

### Heavy ML Inference

Use dedicated inference servers:

* Triton Inference Server
* TensorFlow Serving
* TorchServe

FastAPI should focus on:

* Request handling
* Validation
* Routing

### Long-Running Tasks

Use a queue-based architecture:

```text
FastAPI
    ↓
RabbitMQ / Redis
    ↓
Celery Workers
```

Examples:

* Video processing
* Image manipulation
* Batch jobs
* Report generation

---

## Rule 4: Apply the Same Rules to Dependencies

Dependencies should follow the same concurrency rules.

### Use `def` When

* Calling blocking libraries
* Using synchronous database drivers

### Use `async def` When

* Using async libraries
* Performing lightweight work

### Avoid

* Heavy computations inside dependencies

---

# 2. Background Processing & Task Orchestration

## Rule 5: Use Background Tasks for Lightweight Work

FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` is ideal for fire-and-forget operations.

Examples:

* Sending emails
* Analytics logging
* Notifications

```python
from fastapi import BackgroundTasks

@app.post("/register")
async def register(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):

    background_tasks.add_task(send_email)

    return {"message": "User created"}
```

### Limitations

Do **not** use `BackgroundTasks` when you need:

* Guaranteed delivery
* Retries
* Persistence across crashes

For mission-critical tasks, use:

* Celery
* RabbitMQ
* Redis

---

# 3. Security, Hardening & API Edge Controls

## Rule 6: Disable API Documentation in Production

### Anti-Pattern

Leaving these publicly exposed:

* `/docs`
* `/redoc`
* `/openapi.json`

This reveals:

* Internal schemas
* Endpoint structures
* Experimental APIs

### Production Practice

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from core.config import settings

app = FastAPI(
    docs_url=None if settings.ENVIRONMENT == "production" else "/docs",
    redoc_url=None if settings.ENVIRONMENT == "production" else "/redoc",
    openapi_url=None if settings.ENVIRONMENT == "production" else "/openapi.json",
)
```

---

# 4. Pydantic Architecture & Validation

## Rule 7: Create a Custom Base Model

Avoid inheriting directly from `BaseModel` everywhere.

Create a centralized application base model.

### Benefits

* Global configuration
* Alias generators
* Shared encoders
* Consistent serialization

Example:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class AppBaseModel(BaseModel):

    class Config:
        populate_by_name = True
```

Common use cases:

* Snake case → camel case conversion
* `datetime` serialization
* `Decimal` conversion
* MongoDB `ObjectId` conversion

---

## Rule 8: Let FastAPI Build Response Models

### Anti-Pattern

```python
return UserResponse(
    id=user.id,
    name=user.name
)
```

### Production Practice

Return raw objects:

```python
return {
    "id": user.id,
    "name": user.name
}
```

FastAPI automatically:

1. Validates
2. Serializes
3. Builds the response model

---

## Rule 9: Keep Validation Inside Pydantic

### Anti-Pattern

```python
if age < 18:
    raise Exception()
```

inside route handlers.

### Production Practice

Use validators:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator

class UserCreate(BaseModel):

    age: int

    @field_validator("age")
    @classmethod
    def validate_age(cls, value):

        if value < 18:
            raise ValueError("Age must be at least 18")

        return value
```

Benefits:

* Cleaner routes
* Better OpenAPI docs
* Reusable validation logic

---

# 5. Dependency Injection & Resource Management

## Rule 10: Move Resource Validation Into Dependencies

Examples:

* Ownership checks
* Permission checks
* Record existence validation

Benefits:

* Reusability
* Cleaner endpoints
* Automatic request-level caching

```python
@app.get("/items/{id}")
async def get_item(
    item=Depends(get_existing_item)
):
    return item
```

---

## Rule 11: Use Connection Pools Through Dependency Injection

### Anti-Pattern

Creating a database client for every request.

### Production Practice

Initialize pools once during startup.

```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):

    app.state.db_pool = await create_db_pool()

    yield

    await app.state.db_pool.close()


app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)


async def get_db(request: Request):

    async with request.app.state.db_pool.acquire() as connection:
        yield connection
```

---

## Rule 12: Manage Global State with Lifespan

Avoid:

```python
@app.on_event("startup")
@app.on_event("shutdown")
```

Prefer:

```python
lifespan()
```

Use it for:

* Database pools
* Redis connections
* Kafka consumers
* Cache systems
* Background services

Benefits:

* Centralized initialization
* Better error handling
* Cleaner shutdown

---

# 6. Secure Configuration & Observability

## Rule 13: Centralize Configuration with Pydantic Settings

### Avoid

```python
os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]
```

scattered throughout the project.

### Production Practice

Use:

* `.env`
* `.env.example`
* `pydantic-settings`

Example:

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings


class Settings(BaseSettings):

    DATABASE_URL: str
    ENVIRONMENT: str

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"


settings = Settings()
```

Benefits:

* Startup validation
* Fail fast on missing values
* Type safety

---

## Rule 14: Use Structured JSON Logging

### Avoid

```python
print("User logged in")
```

### Production Practice

Use:

* `logging`
* `structlog`
* `loguru`

Example:

```python
logger.info(
    "user_login",
    user_id=user.id,
    request_id=request_id
)
```

### Include Context

* request_id
* user_id
* trace_id

### Send Logs To

* Fluent Bit
* Logstash
* Elasticsearch

Benefits:

* Better observability
* Easier debugging
* Distributed tracing support

---

# 7. High-Performance Deployment

## Rule 15: Run Uvicorn Behind Gunicorn

Use:

```bash
gunicorn app.main:app -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --workers 5
```

### Why

Gunicorn provides:

* Process management
* Worker supervision
* Better production stability

Uvicorn provides:

* ASGI support
* High-performance networking

### Enable `uvloop`

FastAPI automatically benefits from `uvloop` for improved throughput.

### Worker Formula

```text
workers = (CPU_CORES × 2) + 1
```

Always benchmark before finalizing worker counts.

---

# 2.5 High-Performance Data Access & Task Management

Production-grade FastAPI applications must provide low-latency responses while handling resource-intensive workloads efficiently. Achieving this requires a two-pronged strategy:

- **Caching** to reduce database latency.
- **Task orchestration** to execute long-running operations asynchronously.

---

# Rule 16: Implement Redis for Caching Frequently Accessed Data

Database I/O is often the largest performance bottleneck in web applications. Use **Redis** to cache expensive database queries or computationally intensive results.

## The Caching Pattern

```python
from redis import asyncio as aioredis
import json

# Setup Redis in your lifespan or as a dependency
async def get_cached_user(user_id: int):
    redis = await get_redis_client()

    cached_data = await redis.get(f"user:{user_id}")

    if cached_data:
        return json.loads(cached_data)

    # Cache miss: Fetch from database
    user = await db.fetch_user(user_id)

    # Cache the result with a TTL
    await redis.setex(
        f"user:{user_id}",
        3600,
        json.dumps(user)
    )

    return user
```

---

## Redis Caching Best Practices

### 1. Always Set a TTL (Time-To-Live)

Every cached object should expire automatically to prevent stale data.

```python
await redis.setex(
    "user:42",
    3600,  # 1 hour
    json.dumps(user)
)
```

Benefits:

- Prevents stale cache
- Reduces memory usage
- Enables automatic cache cleanup

---

### 2. Implement Cache Invalidation

Whenever data changes, invalidate the corresponding cache entry.

```python
await db.update_user(user_id, payload)

await redis.delete(f"user:{user_id}")
```

Remember:

> **Cache invalidation is one of the hardest problems in computer science.**

Always ensure cached objects reflect the current database state.

---

### 3. Redis Is Not Your Primary Database

Redis should only store:

- Frequently accessed data
- Expensive database queries
- Computationally expensive results
- Session information
- Rate limiting metadata

Your **primary relational database** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) should always remain the source of truth.

---

## Typical Redis Use Cases

| Use Case | Good Candidate? |
|-----------|-----------------|
| User Profiles | ✅ |
| Product Catalog | ✅ |
| Feature Flags | ✅ |
| Session Storage | ✅ |
| Authentication Tokens | ✅ |
| Dashboard Statistics | ✅ |
| Large Binary Files | ❌ |
| Permanent Business Data | ❌ |

---
# Rule 17: ## 8: Automating Quality Control with `lint.sh` and `fix.sh`

To maintain a production-grade codebase, integrate linting and formatting into your development lifecycle. Use these scripts to enforce standards consistently across your team.

### `fix.sh` (Auto-Correction)
Use this script to automatically clean up code style issues and format files according to project standards.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

echo "Auto-fixing code..."
uv run ruff check . --fix
uv run ruff format .
echo "Formatting completed."
---
# Rule 18: Utilize Celery for Long-Running & Blocking Tasks

Although FastAPI excels at handling asynchronous I/O, it is **not designed for CPU-intensive or long-running background jobs**.

Delegate such work to **Celery workers**, backed by a message broker such as:

- Redis
- RabbitMQ

---

## When to Use Celery

Use Celery whenever a task:

### Time-Consuming

Examples:

- PDF generation
- Excel report generation
- Video transcoding
- AI inference
- Image processing

---

### Depends on Slow External APIs

Examples:

- Email sending
- SMS notifications
- Payment webhooks
- Third-party integrations
- Batch API synchronization

---

### Requires Reliability

If a task:

- Must eventually succeed
- Needs retries
- Should survive server restarts
- Can be processed later

then Celery is the appropriate solution.

---

# Integration Strategy

Keep task definitions separate from your API layer.

```
app/
├── api/
├── services/
├── repositories/
├── tasks/
│   ├── worker.py
│   ├── report_tasks.py
│   ├── email_tasks.py
│   └── notification_tasks.py
```

This separation improves maintainability and keeps business logic decoupled from HTTP request handling.

---

## Example Celery Worker

```python
# app/tasks/worker.py

from celery import Celery

celery_app = Celery(
    "worker",
    broker="redis://localhost:6379/0"
)

@celery_app.task(bind=True, max_retries=3)
def process_heavy_report(self, report_id: int):
    try:
        # Complex business logic
        ...
    except Exception as exc:
        raise self.retry(
            exc=exc,
            countdown=60
        )
```

---

# Production Workflow

## Step 1 — Dispatch the Task

Instead of executing heavy work inside the request, enqueue it.

```python
@router.post("/reports/{report_id}")
async def generate_report(report_id: int):
    process_heavy_report.delay(report_id)

    return {
        "message": "Report generation started."
    }
```

The HTTP response is returned immediately while Celery processes the task asynchronously.

---

## Step 2 — Monitor Workers

Use monitoring tools such as:

- Flower
- Prometheus
- Grafana

Monitor:

- Worker health
- Queue depth
- Running tasks
- Failed tasks
- Retry counts

---

## Step 3 — Isolate Worker Infrastructure

Deploy Celery workers separately from the FastAPI application.

Example Docker architecture:

```
                ┌──────────────┐
                │   FastAPI    │
                └──────┬───────┘
                       │
             Dispatch Task
                       │
                ┌──────▼───────┐
                │ Redis Queue  │
                └──────┬────────┘
                       │
         ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
         │                           │
┌────────▼────────┐        ┌──────────▼─────────┐
│ Celery Worker 1 │        │ Celery Worker 2    │
└─────────────────┘        └────────────────────┘
```

This architecture prevents heavy workloads from consuming resources needed by the API server.

# BackgroundTasks vs Celery

| Feature | FastAPI BackgroundTasks | Celery |
|----------|-------------------------|--------|
| Persistence | In-memory (lost on crash) | Persistent (Redis/RabbitMQ) |
| Retries | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Native retry support |
| Exponential Backoff | ❌ | ✅ |
| Scheduling (Cron Jobs) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Worker Scaling | Tied to API instance | Independent workers |
| Monitoring | Minimal | Flower, Prometheus, Grafana |
| Complexity | Very Low | Moderate |
| Reliability | Low | High |
| Best For | Small background work | Production-grade asynchronous processing |

---

# Choosing the Right Tool

## Use FastAPI `BackgroundTasks` When

- Writing logs
- Sending quick notifications
- Cleaning temporary files
- Lightweight cache updates
- Tasks lasting only a few seconds

---

## Use Celery When

- Processing reports
- Running AI/ML inference
- Sending bulk emails
- Importing/exporting datasets
- Video or image processing
- Scheduled jobs
- Tasks requiring retries
- Mission-critical background workflows

---

# Key Takeaways

- Use **Redis** to minimize database latency by caching frequently accessed or expensive-to-compute data.
- Always configure **TTL** values and implement **cache invalidation** to maintain data consistency.
- Treat Redis as a **cache**, not as the system of record.
- Offload CPU-intensive or long-running tasks to **Celery** to keep API responses fast.
- Deploy Celery workers independently from FastAPI to improve scalability and fault isolation.
- Use **FastAPI BackgroundTasks** only for lightweight, fire-and-forget operations.
- Choose **Celery** whenever reliability, retries, scheduling, or horizontal scaling are required.
```
